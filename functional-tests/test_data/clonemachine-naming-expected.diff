-Contributing to Bitcoin Core
-============================
+# Contributing to unit-e
 
-The Bitcoin Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
+The unit-e project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
 welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
 and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
 contributing.
 
-Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
-developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
-revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
-the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
-purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for
-merging pull requests as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for the
-release cycle, overall merging, moderation and appointment of maintainers.
+There is a team of [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) who take care of
+responsibilities such as merging pull requests, releasing, moderation, and
+appointment of maintainers. Maintainers are part of the overall community and
+there is a path for contributors to become maintainers if they show to be
+capable and willing to take over this responsibility.
 
-If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the
-[good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
-list.
-
-Communication Channels
-----------------------
-
-Most communication about Bitcoin Core development happens on IRC, in the
-#bitcoin-core-dev channel on Freenode. The easiest way to participate on IRC is
-with the web client, [webchat.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/). Chat
-history logs can be found
-on [botbot.me](https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/).
-
-Discussion about code base improvements happens in GitHub issues and on pull
-requests.
-
-The developer
-[mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
-should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working on
-a patch set.
+The unit-e team is committed to fostering a welcoming and harassment-free
+environment. All participants are expected to adhere to our [code of
+conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
 
 Contributor Workflow
 --------------------
 
 The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone
-without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests". This
+without exception contributes patch proposals using GitHub pull requests. This
 facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.
 
+We treat the term code generously in this context and apply it not only to the
+program code itself but to everything which is stored in the code repository,
+including documentation.
+
+### Workflow overview
+
 To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:
 
   1. Fork repository
   1. Create topic branch
   1. Commit patches
+  1. Push changes to your fork
+  1. Create pull request
+  1. Code review
+  1. Merging or closing the pull request
+
+The following sections explain the details of the different steps.
+
+### Fork repository
+
+To start a new patch fork the unit-e repository on GitHub or, if you already
+have a fork, [update its master
+branch](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to the latest version.
+
+This workflow is the same for everybody including those who have write access to
+the main repo to have a consistent, symmetric, and fair workflow. So don't
+create pull requests as branches in the main repo.
+
+### Create topic branch
+
+Create a topic branch in your fork to add your changes there. This makes it
+easier to work on multiple changes in parallel and to track the main repo in the
+master branch.
+
+### Commit patches
 
 The project coding conventions in the [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md)
 must be adhered to.
 
-In general [commits should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)
+In general [commits should be
+atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)

 fixes or code moves with actual code changes.

-  - Push changes to your fork
-  - Create pull request
-
-The title of the pull request should be prefixed by the component or area that
-the pull request affects. Valid areas as:
-
-  - *Consensus* for changes to consensus critical code
-  - *Docs* for changes to the documentation
-  - *Qt* for changes to bitcoin-qt
-  - *Mining* for changes to the mining code
-  - *Net* or *P2P* for changes to the peer-to-peer network code
-  - *RPC/REST/ZMQ* for changes to the RPC, REST or ZMQ APIs
-  - *Scripts and tools* for changes to the scripts and tools
-  - *Tests* for changes to the bitcoin unit tests or QA tests
-  - *Trivial* should **only** be used for PRs that do not change generated
-    executable code. Notably, refactors (change of function arguments and code
-    reorganization) and changes in behavior should **not** be marked as trivial.
-    Examples of trivial PRs are changes to:
-    - comments
-    - whitespace
-    - variable names
-    - logging and messages
-  - *Utils and libraries* for changes to the utils and libraries
-  - *Wallet* for changes to the wallet code
-
-Examples:
-
-    Consensus: Add new opcode for BIP-XXXX OP_CHECKAWESOMESIG
-    Net: Automatically create hidden service, listen on Tor
-    Qt: Add feed bump button
-    Trivial: Fix typo in init.cpp

-If a pull request is not to be considered for merging (yet), please
-prefix the title with [WIP] or use [Tasks Lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists)
-in the body of the pull request to indicate tasks are pending.
+#### Sign your work
 
-The body of the pull request should contain enough description about what the

+for details). That means if you submit a change you sign it off by adding a line
 
-At this stage one should expect comments and review from other contributors. You
-can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing
-to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.
+    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
+
+with your name and email address at the end of every commit message. By adding
+the "Signed-off-by" you state that you have have the right to contribute this change
+and that you do so under the MIT license. The full statement you agree to is the
+[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

-Note: Code review is a burdensome but important part of the development process, and as such, certain types of pull requests are rejected. In general, if the **improvements** do not warrant the **review effort** required, the PR has a high chance of being rejected. It is up to the PR author to convince the reviewers that the changes warrant the review effort, and if reviewers are "Concept NAK'ing" the PR, the author may need to present arguments and/or do research backing their suggested changes.
+    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
 
-Squashing Commits
----------------------------
-If your pull request is accepted for merging, you may be asked by a maintainer
-to squash and or [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your commits
-before it will be merged. The basic squashing workflow is shown below.
+    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
+        have the right to submit it under the open source license
+        indicated in the file; or
 
-    git checkout your_branch_name
-    git rebase -i HEAD~n
-    # n is normally the number of commits in the pull request.
-    # Set commits (except the one in the first line) from 'pick' to 'squash', save and quit.
-    # On the next screen, edit/refine commit messages.
-    # Save and quit.
-    git push -f # (force push to GitHub)
+    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
+        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
+        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
+        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
+        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
+        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
+        in the file; or
 
-If you have problems with squashing (or other workflows with `git`), you can
-alternatively enable "Allow edits from maintainers" in the right GitHub
-sidebar and ask for help in the pull request.
+    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
+        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
+        it.
 
-Please refrain from creating several pull requests for the same change.
-Use the pull request that is already open (or was created earlier) to amend
-changes. This preserves the discussion and review that happened earlier for
-the respective change set.
+    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
+        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
+        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
+        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
+        this project or the open source license(s) involved.
 
-The length of time required for peer review is unpredictable and will vary from
-pull request to pull request.
+When you are passing on patches or are merging changes contributed by others
+preserve the "Signed-off-by" lines at the end of the commit messages and add
+your own one.
 
+You can use git to add the message for you by using the `-s` or `--signoff`
+option:
 
-Pull Request Philosophy
------------------------
+    git commit -s -m "My commit message"
+
+This can be automated using a git hook. Copy the script at
+`contrib/githooks/prepare-commit-msg` to your local `.git/hooks` directory and
+make sure it's executable.
+
+### Create pull request
+
+Open a pull request in the GitHub UI from your branch to the main repository.
+
+Add any additional context or references which are relevant to the process of
+reviewing the changes to the body of the pull request. Information relevant to
+understanding the changes itself should be in the code and commit messages.
+
+Assign reviewers if you want to get feedback from specific people. Generally
+everybody is free to comment on any pull request. It's expected from assigned
+reviewers to give feedback on the pull request. They might remove themselves or
+add others if they feel that they can't approve the pull request themselves.
 
 Patchsets should always be focused. For example, a pull request could add a
 feature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture. Please also avoid super
 pull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complex
 as this makes review difficult.
 
+If a pull request is not to be considered for merging (yet), please prefix the
+title with `WIP:`. You can use [Tasks
+Lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists)

 Project maintainers aim for a quick turnaround on refactoring pull requests, so
 where possible keep them short, uncomplex and easy to verify.
 
-Pull requests that refactor the code should not be made by new contributors. It
-requires a certain level of experience to know where the code belongs to and to
-understand the full ramification (including rebase effort of open pull requests).
+### Code Review
+
+Code review is essential to keep up code quality. It also is a great way to
+learn and to positively collaborate. Good code review improves the code and the
+team.
 
-Trivial pull requests or pull requests that refactor the code with no clear
-benefits may be immediately closed by the maintainers to reduce unnecessary
-workload on reviewing.
+Some great general resources about code review are [Designing awesome code
+reviews](https://medium.com/unpacking-trunk-club/designing-awesome-code-reviews-5a0d9cd867e3)
+(an overview of how to do code reviews that are good for code and people) and
+[Awesome code review](https://github.com/joho/awesome-code-review) (a curated
+list of resources related to code review).
 
+#### Peer Review
 
-"Decision Making" Process
--------------------------
+Anyone may participate in peer review which is expressed by comments in the pull
+request. Use the features of the GitHub review system. Comment on the code,
+propose changes, ask questions, and add a summary of your review.
 
-The following applies to code changes to the Bitcoin Core project (and related
-projects such as libsecp256k1), and is not to be confused with overall Bitcoin
+Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors, as well as
+test out the patch set and opine on the technical merits of the patch. Project
+maintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is
+consensus to merge a pull request. The following
+language is used within pull-request comments:
+
+  - ACK means "I have tested the code and I agree it should be merged";
+  - NACK means "I disagree this should be merged", and must be accompanied by
+    sound technical justification (or in certain cases of
+    copyright/patent/licensing issues, legal justification). NACKs without
+    accompanying reasoning may be disregarded;
+  - utACK means "I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks
+    OK, I agree it can be merged";
+  - Concept ACK means "I agree in the general principle of this pull request";
+  - Nit refers to trivial, often non-blocking issues.
+
+Where a patch set affects consensus critical code, the bar will be set much
+higher in terms of discussion and peer review requirements, keeping in mind that
+mistakes could be very costly to the wider community. This includes refactoring
+of consensus critical code.
+
+Patches that change unit-e consensus rules are considerably more involved than
+normal because they affect the entire ecosystem. They must be accompanied by a
+design document and a discussion will have preceded it, which should be
+referenced (for example the pull request which merged the design document).
+
+While each case will
+be different, one should be prepared to expend more time and effort than for
+other kinds of patches because of increased peer review and consensus building
+requirements.
+
+#### Adding changes to the pull request
+
+At this stage one should expect comments and review from other contributors. You
+can add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing
+to your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.
+
+Add changes as additional commits so that it gives a clear history and that the
+discussion in the pull request on GitHub can be followed along the code.
+
+Find a balance between improving an existing pull request or doing changes as a
+new pull request after the first one has been merged. We are striving for
+quality but not for perfection. Small pull requests help with that because they
+make reviews easier and more effective.
+
+When you are rebasing a branch of a pull request to merge in other changes from
+master or to clean up commits you need to force push to share your changes. Be
+aware that this breaks the history of the pull request on GitHub, might
+invalidate or confuse discussions, and forces people who have local checkouts of
+the branch to re-checkout. Be careful when force pushing. You might want to
+consider opening a new pull request when that makes things clearer without
+adding too much effort or noise.
+
+#### Decision by maintainers
+
+The following applies to code changes to the unit-e project (and related
+projects such as libsecp256k1), and is not to be confused with overall Unit-e
 Network Protocol consensus changes.
 
-Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge
-maintainers and ultimately the project lead.
+Whether and when a pull request is merged into unit-e rests with the project
+maintainers. A pull request needs approval of at least one maintainer to be
+merged. A maintainer can not approve a pull request they authored themselves.
+They need at least one other maintainer to approve the pull request. The list of
+maintainers is documented in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).
+
+If maintainers ask for changes, and the changes have been done by adding
+additional commits to the pull request, they need to approve the changes before
+the pull request can be merged.
+
+Approval is expressed by using the GitHub review mechanics. If, as a maintainer,
+you approve the patch for merge, select the "approve" option in the GitHub UI
+when submitting your review. If you request changes, select the corresponding
+option to require submission and review of additional changes.
+
+Approval of a pull request is a strong statement. It expresses that the approver
+takes responsibility that the change will work, does not break anything else,
+has sufficient test coverage, and will be maintained in the future. Approving a
+pull request expresses the same level of confidence that the change is good to
+be shipped as actually merging it.

-    OK, I agree it can be merged";
-  - Concept ACK means "I agree in the general principle of this pull request";
-  - Nit refers to trivial, often non-blocking issues.
+Use the GitHub button for squashing and merging. Be careful with editing the
+commit message during the squash as this is what directly will end up in the
+main code branch. Copy relevant information from the pull request description as
+needed.
 
-Reviewers should include the commit hash which they reviewed in their comments.
+There are some exceptions to the rule to squash commits, for example when
+merging upstream code and the commits and authors should be kept as they are.
 
-Project maintainers reserve the right to weigh the opinions of peer reviewers

+Release Policy
+--------------
 
-Where a patch set proposes to change the Bitcoin consensus, it must have been
-discussed extensively on the mailing list and IRC, be accompanied by a widely
-discussed BIP and have a generally widely perceived technical consensus of being
-a worthwhile change based on the judgement of the maintainers.
-
-### Finding Reviewers
-
-As most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review
-process can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find
-that you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several
-months, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something
-about:
-
-  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,
-    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,
-    it will not be prioritized until the release is over. Wait for release.
-  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than
-    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
-    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change
-    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take
-    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting
-    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the
-    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.
-    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give
-    their opinion on the concept itself.
-  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people. And those people
-    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who
-    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the
-    [Git Blame feature](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/). Simply
-    find the person touching the code you are touching before you and see if you can find
-    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging though.
-  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request
-    a look. If you think you've been waiting an unreasonably long amount of time (month+) for
-    no particular reason (few lines changed, etc), this is totally fine. Try to return the favor
-    when someone else is asking for feedback on their code, and universe balances out.

+[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). We use the [Developer
+Certificate of Origin (DCO)](#sign-your-work) to make clear that you have the
+right to contribute your changes and do so under the chosen license.
+
+There are very few exceptions where files have different licenses than MIT. In
+these cases contributions need to follow the stated license. New files should
+always be contributed under the MIT license.
+
+Each file is required to have a license header which contains a copyright notice
+and states the license under which the file is licensed. While it is not
+strictly required from a legal point of view to do that for every single file,
+it does add clarity, also for the case a file is taken out of context of the
+repository.
+
+The copyright notice states who holds the copyright of the file and when the
+copyrightable work was done. It usually is in the form of "Copyright (c)
+<year-range> <name>". For the work done by the Unit-e community we use "The
+Unit-e developers" as the overall name. More fine-grained attribution is
+recorded in the git history.
+
+Never remove a copyright notice unless you remove all of the code covered by it.
+
+Add a copyright notice when you add a substantial amount of work not covered by
+the existing copyright notice.
+
+There is a script to add license headers to new files, update year ranges in
+copyright notices, and create reports about copyright statements in
+[`contrib/devtools/copyright_header.py`](contrib/devtools/copyright_header.py).
+You can use that to add a proper license header when you are creating new files.

----------
+If you are incorporating code from other sources make sure that its license
+allows that, keep license headers and attributions, and add a reference to its

+[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dtr-org/unit-e.svg?token=bm5dxUvwqj2MkNmT6JSA&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dtr-org/unit-e)
 
-What is Bitcoin?
-----------------
+The unit-e client is the first implementation of a client for the Unit-e
+cryptocurrency network protocol.
 
-Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
-anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
-with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
-out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source
-software which enables the use of this currency.
+## What is Unit-e?
 
-For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
-the Bitcoin Core software, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/, or read the
-[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).
+[Unit-e](https://dtr.org/unit-e) is a new cryptocurrency, providing a scalable
+and decentralized monetary and payment network based on current scientific
+research. It is the first project supported by the [Distributed Technology
+Research foundation (DTR)](https://dtr.org). Its design is backed by the
+[research](https://dtr.org/research/) DTR is funding, delivering the scalable
+performance needed to enter mainstream use.
 
-License
--------
+## The unit-e client
 
-Bitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
-information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.
+This repository hosts the implementation of the first Unit-e client: `unit-e`,
+also known as the "Feuerland" client. It is based on the [Bitcoin
+Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) code base as upstream and adds
+features such as:
 
-Development Process
--------------------
+* Replace Proof of Work by [Proof of Stake with on-chain block
+  finalization](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e-docs/blob/master/specs/spec_v1.0.md)
+  and [remote staking](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/UIP-0015.md).
+* Native SegWit support
+* Reduced bandwidth, storage, and time to sync of initial blockchain download by
+  [UTXO snapshots](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/UIP-0011.md)
+* Enhanced privacy through Dandelion Lite
+* Optimized block propagation through Graphene
+* [Canonical transaction
+  ordering](https://github.com/dtr-org/uips/blob/master/UIP-0024.md)
+* Hardware wallet support
 
-The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
-completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
-regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.
+We regularly merge upstream changes into the unit-e code base and also strive to
+contribute back changes which are relevant for upstream. The last upstream sync
+was done with the [0.16](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/0.16) version,
+plus some changes cherry-picked from later development branches.
 
-The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
+The client is in a pre-testnet development phase. With the [launch of the
+testnet](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/milestone/11) we will start a regular
+cadence of releases.
 
-Testing
--------
+## Running from source
 
-Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
-requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
-other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
-lots of money.
+To run unit-e from sources you will need to check it out from this GitHub
+repository, compile it, and launch the resulting binary. This currently is the
+only supported way of running it. Detailed instructions for a variety of
+platforms can be found in the
+[docs](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/tree/master/doc) directory.
 
-### Automated Testing
+## Development
 
-Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
-submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
-(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
-and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).
+Development takes place on the `master` branch. All code changes go through
+peer-reviewed and tested pull requests. We aim for meeting high standards as an
+open source project and a collaborative community project. The contribution
+workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
 
-There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
-in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
-These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`
+The Unit-e team is committed to fostering a welcoming and harassment-free
+environment. All participants are expected to adhere to our [code of
+conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
 
-The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.
+## Testing
 
-### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
+We strive to keep the unit-e code base fully tested and covered by automated
+tests.
 
-Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
-code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
-to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
-not straightforward.
+Unit tests can be compiled and run with: `make check`. Further details on
+running and extending unit tests can be found in
+[src/test/README.md](src/test/README.md).
 
-Translations
-------------
+There are also [functional tests](test), including regression and integration
+tests. They are written in Python and most of them are also run as part of
+automated continuous integration. These tests can be run locally with
+`test/functional/test_runner.py`.
 
-Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
-[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
+Unit and functional tests are [run on
+Travis](https://travis-ci.com/dtr-org/unit-e) as part of our continuous
+integration system. This tests the master branch and all pull requests. It makes
+sure that code is checked, built and tested for Windows, Linux, and OS X
+automatically before it gets merged into master.
 
-Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
-[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.
+Any additional testing, automated or manual, is very welcome. If you encounter
+any issues or run into bugs please report them as
+[issues](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/issues).
 
-**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
-pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
+## Related repositories
 
-Translators should also subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-translators).

-Coding Style (General)
-----------------------
+Style guide C++
+---------------
 
 Various coding styles have been used during the history of the codebase,
 and the result is not very consistent. However, we're now trying to converge to
-a single style, which is specified below. When writing patches, favor the new
-style over attempting to mimic the surrounding style, except for move-only
-commits.
-
-Do not submit patches solely to modify the style of existing code.
+a single style. We are sticking to the
+[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
 
-Coding Style (C++)
-------------------
+This includes aiming for a [maximum line length of 80
+characters](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Line_Length).
 
-- **Indentation and whitespace rules** as specified in
-[src/.clang-format](/src/.clang-format). You can use the provided
-[clang-format-diff script](/contrib/devtools/README.md#clang-format-diffpy)
-tool to clean up patches automatically before submission.
-  - Braces on new lines for classes, functions, methods.
-  - Braces on the same line for everything else.
-  - 4 space indentation (no tabs) for every block except namespaces.
-  - No indentation for `public`/`protected`/`private` or for `namespace`.
-  - No extra spaces inside parenthesis; don't do ( this )
-  - No space after function names; one space after `if`, `for` and `while`.
-  - If an `if` only has a single-statement `then`-clause, it can appear
-    on the same line as the `if`, without braces. In every other case,
-    braces are required, and the `then` and `else` clauses must appear
-    correctly indented on a new line.
+There are a few additional rules:
 
 - **Symbol naming conventions**. These are preferred in new code, but are not
 required when doing so would need changes to significant pieces of existing
 code.
-  - Variable and namespace names are all lowercase, and may use `_` to
-    separate words (snake_case).
+  - Variable (including function arguments) and namespace names are all lowercase, and may use _ to separate words (snake_case).
     - Class member variables have a `m_` prefix.
+    - Public struct member variables don't have `m_` prefix.
     - Global variables have a `g_` prefix.
   - Constant names are all uppercase, and use `_` to separate words.
   - Class names, function names and method names are UpperCamelCase
     (PascalCase). Do not prefix class names with `C`.
-  - Test suite naming convention: The Boost test suite in file
-    `src/test/foo_tests.cpp` should be named `foo_tests`. Test suite names
-    must be unique.
+
+- **Includes**. Make sure to always use `<>` notation instead of the "".
+  This is done mostly for consistency with the current codebase.
+
+- **Forward declarations**. Forward declarations of classes and structs are allowed and welcome,
+especially when they solve circular dependencies problem or increase recompilation time. But note that
+forward declarations of functions and templated classes are prohibited according to Google Style Guide.
+
+- **If-Statements**.
+    - Always use braces around if statements, even blocks
+      that contain just one statement.
+    - Prefer early return as a guard clause
+      ```c++
+      if (!smth) {
+        return;
+      }
+
+      // continue with the valid case
+      ```
+
+- **namespace**.
+    - files in `src/` don't have namespace
+    - files in `src/directory` have `directory` namespace
+    - avoid nested directories/namespaces
+
+- **Uniform initialization**. Rationale:
+  [Uniform initialization isn't](https://medium.com/@barryrevzin/uniform-initialization-isnt-82533d3b9c11).
+  - In call sites: *Use parentheses to initialize in all cases. Use braces only for the specific behavior that braces provide.*
+  - When declaring classes: *Avoid writing class interfaces in which an ambiguity between uniform initialization and list-initializer syntax might arise.*
 
 - **Miscellaneous**
   - `++i` is preferred over `i++`.
   - `nullptr` is preferred over `NULL` or `(void*)0`.
   - `static_assert` is preferred over `assert` where possible. Generally; compile-time checking is preferred over run-time checking.
-  - `enum class` is preferred over `enum` where possible. Scoped enumerations avoid two potential pitfalls/problems with traditional C++ enumerations: implicit conversions to int, and name clashes due to enumerators being exported to the surrounding scope.

-
-**Sanitizers**
-
-Bitcoin Core can be compiled with various "sanitizers" enabled, which add
-instrumentation for issues regarding things like memory safety, thread race
-conditions, or undefined behavior. This is controlled with the
-`--with-sanitizers` configure flag, which should be a comma separated list of
-sanitizers to enable. The sanitizer list should correspond to supported
-`-fsanitize=` options in your compiler. These sanitizers have runtime overhead,
-so they are most useful when testing changes or producing debugging builds.
-
-Some examples:
-
-```bash
-# Enable both the address sanitizer and the undefined behavior sanitizer
-./configure --with-sanitizers=address,undefined
-
-# Enable the thread sanitizer
-./configure --with-sanitizers=thread
+# A coverage report will now be accessible at `./test_unite.coverage/index.html`.
 ```
 
-If you are compiling with GCC you will typically need to install corresponding
-"san" libraries to actually compile with these flags, e.g. libasan for the
-address sanitizer, libtsan for the thread sanitizer, and libubsan for the
-undefined sanitizer. If you are missing required libraries, the configure script
-will fail with a linker error when testing the sanitizer flags.
-
-The test suite should pass cleanly with the `thread` and `undefined` sanitizers,
-but there are a number of known problems when using the `address` sanitizer. The
-address sanitizer is known to fail in
-[sha256_sse4::Transform](/src/crypto/sha256_sse4.cpp) which makes it unusable
-unless you also use `--disable-asm` when running configure. We would like to fix
-sanitizer issues, so please send pull requests if you can fix any errors found
-by the address sanitizer (or any other sanitizer).
-
-Not all sanitizer options can be enabled at the same time, e.g. trying to build
-with `--with-sanitizers=address,thread` will fail in the configure script as
-these sanitizers are mutually incompatible. Refer to your compiler manual to
-learn more about these options and which sanitizers are supported by your
-compiler.

-----------

+via subtree updates in bitcoin upstream and then merged to unit-e with a bitcoin
+merge.
+
+Where this is too slow changes might also be done via pull request to the
+Bitcoin Core version of the code. See the [bitcoin developer
+notes](https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#subtrees)
+for their policies on that.
 
-Several parts of the repository are subtrees of software maintained elsewhere.
+If something needs to be merged urgently we create a fork of the repo where the
+subtree is coming from, apply the patches there and merge that as subtree from
+our fork. This makes it clear where changes are coming from and it keeps the
+integrity of the git subtrees in the unit-e repository without local changes.

-### File Descriptor Counts
+- src/univalue
 
-In most configurations we use the default LevelDB value for `max_open_files`,
-which is 1000 at the time of this writing. If LevelDB actually uses this many
-file descriptors it will cause problems with Bitcoin's `select()` loop, because
-it may cause new sockets to be created where the fd value is >= 1024. For this
-reason, on 64-bit Unix systems we rely on an internal LevelDB optimization that
-uses `mmap()` + `close()` to open table files without actually retaining
-references to the table file descriptors. If you are upgrading LevelDB, you must
-sanity check the changes to make sure that this assumption remains valid.
+  Upstream at https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue
 
-In addition to reviewing the upstream changes in `env_posix.cc`, you can use `lsof` to
-check this. For example, on Linux this command will show open `.ldb` file counts:
+### Checking subtrees
 
-```bash
-$ lsof -p $(pidof bitcoind) |\
-    awk 'BEGIN { fd=0; mem=0; } /ldb$/ { if ($4 == "mem") mem++; else fd++ } END { printf "mem = %s, fd = %s\n", mem, fd}'
-mem = 119, fd = 0
-```
+There is a tool in
+[contrib/devtools/git-subtree-check.sh](../contrib/devtools/git-subtree-check.sh)
+to check a subtree directory for consistency with its upstream repository. Run
+it for example as:
 
-The `mem` value shows how many files are mmap'ed, and the `fd` value shows you
-many file descriptors these files are using. You should check that `fd` is a
-small number (usually 0 on 64-bit hosts).

+### Updating subtrees
 
-### Consensus Compatibility
+Git subtrees are updated from the upstream repos as they are listed
+[above](#current-subtrees) using the `git subtree` command:
 
-It is possible for LevelDB changes to inadvertently change consensus
-compatibility between nodes. This happened in Bitcoin 0.8 (when LevelDB was
-first introduced). When upgrading LevelDB you should review the upstream changes
-to check for issues affecting consensus compatibility.
+    git subtree pull --prefix src/${prefix} ${remote_repo} ${ref} --squash
 
-For example, if LevelDB had a bug that accidentally prevented a key from being
-returned in an edge case, and that bug was fixed upstream, the bug "fix" would
-be an incompatible consensus change. In this situation the correct behavior
-would be to revert the upstream fix before applying the updates to Bitcoin's
-copy of LevelDB. In general you should be wary of any upstream changes affecting
-what data is returned from LevelDB queries.
+The `remote_repo` is the URL or path to the upstream repo, `ref` is the branch.
+The commits are squashed so that a subtree update consists of a commit
+containing all changes since the last update and a merge commit pulling in this
+commit into the code base.

 API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically.

 ### Helping to translate (using Transifex)
 Transifex is setup to monitor the GitHub repo for updates, and when code containing new translations is found, Transifex will process any changes. It may take several hours after a pull-request has been merged, to appear in the Transifex web interface.

 ### Writing code with translations
 We use automated scripts to help extract translations in both Qt, and non-Qt source files. It is rarely necessary to manually edit the files in `src/qt/locale/`. The translation source files must adhere to the following format:
-`bitcoin_xx_YY.ts or bitcoin_xx.ts`
+`unite_xx_YY.ts or unite_xx.ts`
 
-`src/qt/locale/bitcoin_en.ts` is treated in a special way. It is used as the source for all other translations. Whenever a string in the source code is changed, this file must be updated to reflect those changes. A custom script is used to extract strings from the non-Qt parts. This script makes use of `gettext`, so make sure that utility is installed (ie, `apt-get install gettext` on Ubuntu/Debian). Once this has been updated, `lupdate` (included in the Qt SDK) is used to update `bitcoin_en.ts`.
